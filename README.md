### Keynote by Sebastian Meyer

We have the distinct pleasure of welcoming the most recent member of the R Core development team, [Sebastian Meyer](http://www.imbe.med.uni-erlangen.de/ma/S.Meyer/), for a keynote presentation.

### R Core Panel -- Discussion

Following the keynote, three more members of R Core will join Sebastian for a panel discussion:

-   Tomas Kalibera
-   Martin Maechler
-   Luke Tierney

As an R Foundation Board member, I have been asked to moderate the session with its keynote and panel discussion. I would like to ask the R Community *at large* to please *submit questions* as [issue tickets in this repository](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/user2022-r-core-panel/issues), and to use the 'thumbs-up' / 'thumbs-down' mechanism to sort the questions. We will aim to use some of the most-upvoted grassroots questions to guide the discussion.

### Possible Topics

This is not an exhaustive list but more of a guided tour:

-   What are some of the ongoing and/or planned initiatives, both short-term and longer-term, that the R Core team is undertaking and would like to talk about?

-   What other (current or future) topics should R users be (more) aware of?

-   How can one contribute to R itself, and how can one work with the R Core team? How can the [contributor working group](https://contributor.r-project.org/working-group) be helped further ? How about the [bug BBQ *this Friday*](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/bug-bbq) ?

-   What is the governance of R development as driven by R Core? Other than its 'uniqueness' would you be to describe strength, weakness, as well as possible vulnerabilities, of the current governance structure?

-   Succession and the 'bus factor': How do you feel about where R, and R Core, may be in five years? Ten? Fifteen? What, if any, initiatives can ensure it will be as vibrant at the 40th anniversary of R 1.0.0 as it was on Feb 29, 2020, for the 20th?

### And one Non-Topic

If I may, and in my capacity as session chair, I would like to ask that CRAN be off-limits as a topic. CRAN is not a formal R Foundation, or R Core, project. Rather, it is an initiative by the CRAN maintainer team none of whom are attending the panel. We hope to revisit this topic another time.
